## Analog debugging

In power electronic systems, the proper function of the controlling
microcontroller must be tested and verified just like with any piece
of software. For this purpose it is often useful and
can sometimes even prove essential to be able to monitor not only the
states of the digital pins, but also changes in internal values i.e.
variables over time. We call this analog debugging here and it can
provide significant insight into the microcontroller's function.
Using an oscilloscope to monitor voltages and currents side-by-side
with virtual values allows to quickly get to the root of many
problems from ADC conversion issues to control formula and
calculation implementation errors.
